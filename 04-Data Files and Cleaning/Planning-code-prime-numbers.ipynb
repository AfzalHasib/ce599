You should have all the tools you need, by now, and just need a bit of practice at putting the pieces together to solve a problem.  The problem we want to solve is how to test whether a whole number is a prime number. Recall that a Prime Number can be divided evenly only by 1 or itself, and it must be a whole number greater than 1. \n",

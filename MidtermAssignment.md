# Societal Context Assignment

CE 599-002: Data Science in Transportation

Spring 2018

Facilitated In-Class Discussions: April 17, 19 and 24

Papers Due: May 4, 2017, 5 pm in OHR 261

**Connection to Student Outcomes**

ABET has identified the following student outcomes for engineering programs.  This assignment relates to outcomes g through j, shown below in bold.  

(a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering  
(b) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data  
(c) an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability  
(d) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams  
(e) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems  
(f) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility  
**(g) an ability to communicate effectively**  
**(h) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context**  
**(i) a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning**  
**(j) a knowledge of contemporary issues**  
(k) an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.

Broadly, it asks the students to consider our work as engineers and data scientists in relation to a broader societal context.  The assignment is to consider one of three books or reports, and communicate, both in class and in writing how the literature relates to contemporary issues in transportation and data science.  

The task is assigned in the hope that it provides a model by which students can continue to engage with the larger implications of their work, in their role as engineers and as citizens.  

**Deliverables**

The deliverables for this assignment are: 

1. The student must coordinate with the other students assigned the same topic to facilitate a 20-30 minute in-class discussion.  Students assigned other topics will not have read the material, so the discussion must start with a concise summary of the assigned book/report, and focus on key questions as it relates to contemporary issues.   
2. A 5,000 word essay addressing the topic at hand. The essay should be completed individually, and incorporate information from the source material, from the in-class discussion, and original ideas reflecting the student's own thinking.  

**Topics**

There are three topics to choose from.  Students should email the professor with their first, second and third choice, and the topics will be assigned such that there is an equal distribution of students to topics.
